# Object-Oriented Rock Paper Scissors Example

This programme was created in February 2018 for an exercise in object-oriented programming. This repository has been copied from a folder in an older repository, found [here](https://github.com/MagneticRegulus/120_oop). This is meant to show an example of my own coding abilities.

This repo contains the following:

1. older_versions - this folder includes the first 5 iterations of the project, following along with an online course. The approach to this project and my notes are included in this folder.
2. bonus_feature - this folder includes iterations of the program with additional bonus features. The challenges as well as my notes and approach to each are found in this folder as well.
3. rps_final.rb - the completed project, including all finished bonus features.

## A Note on the Program

This program is meant to be played on the terminal by invoking `ruby rps_final.rb`.
